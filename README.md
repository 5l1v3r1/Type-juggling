# Type-juggling
here are 6 exercises to slove where you have to compare your input to string '0'. these exercises will give you the understanding of type juggling.

unzip the file into your webroot.

some exercise can be achieved by using scripts. If you are not able to create it yourself you can use that solutions.zip file. There are 3 python scripts. session_py and session_2.py are for the same exercise but in two different ways, I have not uploaded a script for the last challenge. You have to create it yourself.
